    <li>1/2 pound (225g) fresh sausages, such as chorizo or Italian sausage</li>
    <li>1 pound (450g) smoked sausage, such as linguica or kielbasa</li>
    <li>1 smoked ham hock or shank</li>
    <li>3 to 4 bay leaves</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>1 14.5 ounce can (411g) crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
</ul>

<h1>Method</h1>

<ol>
    <h2><li>Soak the beans in hot water:</li></h2>
        <p>Pour boiling water over the black beans and let them sit while you prepare the rest of the stew.</p>

    <h2><li>Brown the pork shoulder:</li></h2>
        <p>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat and brown the pork shoulder. When the meat has browned, remove the meat from the pot, set aside.</p>

    <h2><li>Brown the onions and add garlic:</li></h2>
        <p>Add the onions to the pot. Brown them, stirring occasionally, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.</p>
        <p>Sprinkle a little salt over the onions and add the garlic. Stir well and sauté 2 more minutes.</p>

    <h2><li>Add the meat, bay leaves, and water:</li></h2>
        <p>Add back the pork shoulder and the other meats. Add enough water to cover all ingredients. Add the bay leaves, cover, and bring to a simmer. Cook gently for 1 hour.</p>

    <h2><li>Add the soaked black beans:</li></h2>
        <p>Drain the black beans from their soaking liquid and add them to the stew. Simmer gently, covered, until the beans are tender, about an hour and a half.</p>

    <h2><li>Add the tomatoes:</li></h2>
        <p>Add the tomatoes, stir well and taste for salt, adding if it's needed. Simmer this, uncovered, until the meat begins to fall off the ham hock, which will probably take 2 to 3 hours.</p>
