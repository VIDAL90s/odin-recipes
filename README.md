# odin-recipes

<p>My experience with this "task" on "the odin project" program was great! I feel like i'm way more used to work with the terminal, github, and know way better what commands to use and when to commit my progress.</p>
<p>In this project I think I now know more about how to create links, develop basic web pages full of lists, text and images.</p>
